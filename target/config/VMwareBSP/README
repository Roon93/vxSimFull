                 README: PC-386/486/Pentium[234]/iacsflP[23]

This file contains board-specific information for a generic PC-386/486/
Pentium[234]/iacsflP[23] target board.  
This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats
that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's reference entry (e.g., man pcXXXX for UNIX or the HTML reference
entries) provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks.
The target reference entry should be read fully before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 1.2/2
	First release for Tornado 2.2 
	replaced NUMBER_OF_IRQS with sysInumTblNumEnt
	added sysBp(TRUE in default) that is used by sysSerial.c and xxIntr.c
	added CPU type PENTIUM[234], removed CPU_VARIANT
	added sysCsSuper, sysCsExc, sysCsInt in sysALib.s
	removed sysCodeSelector, ROM_XXX offset macro, ideDrv
	updated CPUID (sysCpuId) structure:
	  sysCpuId.version -> sysCpuId.signature
	  sysCpuId.vendor  -> sysCpuId.vendorId

	updated sysCpuProbe(), sysIntEoiGet(), [li]oApicIntr.c
	renamed INT_VEC_GET()/XXX_INT_VEC to INT_NUM_GET()/INT_NUM_XXX

	The WRS Intel 80x86-based and Pentium-based BSP Makefiles formerly
	defined bootrom_high, vxWorks_low, and vxWorks_rom_low build
	targets.  These images are deprecated and will no longer be

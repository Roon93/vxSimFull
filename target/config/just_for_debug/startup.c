/*****************************************************************************
*
* routedIfInit - initialize interface information
*
* This routine behaves differently based on the <ifindex> parameter.
* If <ifIndex> is 0, this routine searches the kernel's "ifnet" interface
* list for all interfaces belonging to the AF_INET family and copies the
* interface data into RIP private interface table list if that interface is UP.
* If <ifIndex> is non-zero then only the specified interface is queried
* and its data copied if the interface is UP.
*
* Interfaces that are down are ignored.
*
* For every interface retrieved from the kernel, this routine checks if
* a route for the interface address already exists in RIP's table. If it does
* this signifies that RIP already knows about this interface address; hence it
* skips over that entry. If a route doesn't exist, then RIP adds a route
* to that interface in its own table as well as in the system Routing database.
* The above procedure is repeated for each address entry present for an
* interface.
*
* If an interface has multiple IP addresses (aliases), this routine creates
* a different interface entry (virtual interface) for each address. 
* For example an interface "fei0" in the system with address "100.10.1.1"
* and "144.1.1.1" will result in two interfaces in RIP's interface list - 
* 	1) "fei0", 100.10.1.1
*	2) "fei0", 144.1.1.1

* The <resetFlag> parameter distinguishes the initial execution of this
* routine from later executions which add new interfaces to the list. 
* It is used to initialize RIP's interface list.
*
* If the sytem runs out of memory during uring the addition of an interface
* to RIP's internal list, or if is encounters some incomplete entries, 
* the "lookforinterfaces" flag is set to automatically repeat the execution
* of this routine at the next timer interval. 
*
* The initial execution of this routine (during RIP startup) must succeed
* or the session will not begin, but the session will continue regardless
* of the results of later executions.
*
* RETURNS: OK, or ERROR if unable to process interface table.
*
* NOMANUAL
*
* INTERNAL
* After the RIP session has started, the routine can be called again
* within the context of either the RIP timer task or the RIP input task. 
* The caller should take the ripLockSem semaphore to provide mutual
* exclusion so that no message processing happens while the 
* interface list is changed and any corresponding route entries are
* created.

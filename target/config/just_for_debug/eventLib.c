modification history
--------------------
01e,13nov02,bwa  Fix bad signal handling when task waiting for events (SPR
                 83740). Added option to allow not to clear unwanted events
		 in a call to eventReceive() (SPR 84417).
01d,09nov01,aeg  changed eventPendQ to global symbol vxEventPendQ for WindSh;
		 fixed problem in eventStart() where a re-registration would
		 not delete the previous one.
01c,30oct01,bwa  Corrected use of windview instrumentation for task-state
                 transition logging. Added eventRsrcSend().
01b,25oct01,tcr  remove #undef WV_INSTRUMENTATION
01a,20sep01,bwa  written

DESCRIPTION
Events are a means of communication between tasks and interrupt routines,
based on a synchronous model. Only tasks can receive events, and both tasks
and ISRs can send them.

Events are similar to signals in that they are directed at one task but differ
in the fact that they are synchronous in nature. Thus, the receiving task must
pend when waiting for events to occur. Also, unlike signals, a handler is not
needed since, when wanted events are received, the pending task continues its
execution (like after a call to msgQReceive() or semTake()).

Each task has its own events field that can be filled by having tasks (even
itself) and/or ISRs sending events to the task. Each event's meaning is
different for every task. Event X when received can be interpreted differently
by separate tasks. Also, it should be noted that events are not accumulated.
If the same event is received several times, it counts as if it were received
only once. It is not possible to track how many times each event has been sent 
to a task.

There are some VxWorks objects that can send events when they become available.
They are referred to as 'resources' in the context of events. They include
semaphores and message queues. For example, when a semaphore becomes free,
events can be sent to a task that asked for it.

INTERNAL:
	WINDVIEW INSTRUMENTATION
Level 1:
	eventSend () causes EVENT_EVENTSEND
	eventReceive() causes EVENT_EVENTRECEIVE

Level 2:
	eventSend () causes EVENT_OBJ_EVENTSEND
	eventReceive () causes EVENT_OBJ_EVENTRECEIVE

Level 3:
	N/A

* eventReceive - Wait for event(s)
*
* Pends task until one or all specified <events> have occurred. When
* they have, <pEventsReceived> will be filled with those that did occur.
*
* The <options> parameter is used for four user options. Firstly, it is used 
* to specify if the task is going to wait for all events to occur or only one 
* of them. One of the following has to be selected:
* .iP "EVENTS_WAIT_ANY (0x1)"
* only one event has to occur
* .iP "EVENTS_WAIT_ALL (0x0)"
* will wait until all events occur.
* .LP
* Secondly, it is used to specify if the events returned in <pEventsReceived>
* will be only those received and wanted, or all events received (even the
* ones received before eventReceive() was called). By default it returns
* only the events wanted.
* .iP "EVENTS_RETURN_ALL (0x2)"
* When this option is turned on, it causes the function to return received
* events, both wanted and unwanted. All events are cleared when this option
* is selected.
* .LP
* Thirdly, the user can specify if the events received but not wanted are to
* be cleared or not in the calling task's events register. They are cleared
* by default. Wanted events are always cleared.
* .iP "EVENTS_KEEP_UNWANTED (0x4)"
* Tells the system not to clear the unwanted events. In the case that the
* option EVENTS_RETURN_ALL is used, all events are cleared even if this one
* is selected.
* .LP
* Lastly, it can be used to retrieve what events have been received by the
* current task.
* .iP "EVENTS_FETCH (0x80)"
* If this option is set, then <pEventsReceived> will be filled with the events
* that have already been received and will return immediately. In this case,
* the parameters <events> and <timeout>, as well as all the other options, are
* ignored. Also, events are not cleared, allowing to get a peek at the events
* that have already been received.
* .LP
*
* The <timeout> parameter specifies the number of ticks to wait for wanted
* events to be sent to the waiting task. It can also have the following 
* special values:
* .iP "NO_WAIT  (0)"
* return immediately, even if no events have arrived.
* .iP "WAIT_FOREVER  (-1)"
* never time out.
* .LP
*
* The parameter <pEventsReceived> is always filled with the events received
* even when the function returns an error, except if a value of NULL was
* passed.
*
* WARNING: This routine may not be used from interrupt level.
*
* RETURNS:
* OK on success or ERROR.
*
* ERRNO
* .iP "S_eventLib_TIMEOUT"
* Wanted events not received before specified time expired.
* .iP "S_eventLib_NOT_ALL_EVENTS"
* Specified NO_WAIT as the timeout parameter and wanted events were not already
* received when the routine was called.
* .iP "S_objLib_OBJ_DELETED"
* Task is waiting for some events from a resource that is subsequently deleted.
* .iP "S_intLib_NOT_ISR_CALLABLE"
* Function has been called from ISR.
* .iP "S_eventLib_ZERO_EVENTS"
* The <events> parameter has been passed a value of 0.

DESCRIPTION
This library contains miscellaneous routines which handle duplicate routes
to the same destination address. The router stack version of the network
stack uses these routines support the add, delete, and change operations.

None of the routines in this library are published or available to customers.

INTERNAL
All the routines within this library execute while the system holds the
internal table lock, if needed.

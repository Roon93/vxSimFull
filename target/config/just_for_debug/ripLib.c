DESCRIPTION
This library implements versions 1 and 2 of the Routing Information Protocol 
(RIP). The protocol is intended to operate as an interior gateway protocol
within a relatively small network with a longest path of 15 hops.

HIGH-LEVEL INTERFACE
The ripLibInit() routine links this library into the VxWorks image and begins
a RIP session. This happens automatically if INCLUDE_RIP is defined at the
time the image is built. Once started, RIP will maintain the network routing 
table until deactivated by a call to the ripShutdown() routine, which will 
remove all route entries and disable the RIP library routines. All RIP
requests and responses are handled as defined in the RFC specifications.
RFC 1058 defines the basic protocol operation and RFC 1723 details the
extensions that constitute version 2.

When acting as a supplier, outgoing route updates are filtered using simple
split horizon. Split horizon with poisoned reverse is not currently available.
Additional route entries may be excluded from the periodic update with the
ripSendHookAdd() routine. 

If a RIP session is terminated, the networking subsystem may not function 
correctly until RIP is restarted with a new call to ripLibInit() unless
routing information is provided by some other method.

CONFIGURATION INTERFACE
By default, a RIP session only uses the network interfaces created before it
started. The ripIfSearch() routine allows RIP to recognize any interfaces 
added to the system after that point. If the address or netmask of an
existing interface is changed during a RIP session, the ripIfReset() 
routine must be used to update the RIP configuration appropriately.
The current RIP implementation also automatically performs the border
gateway filtering required by the RFC specification. Those restrictions
provide correct operation in a mixed environment of RIP-1 and RIP-2 routers.
The ripFilterDisable() routine will remove those limitations, and can produce
more efficient routing for some topologies. However, you must not use that 
routine if any version 1 routers are present. The ripFilterEnable() routine 
will restore the default behavior. 

AUTHENTICATION INTERFACE
By default, authentication is disabled, but may be activated by an SNMP
agent on an interface-specific basis. While authentication is disabled,
any RIP-2 messages containing authentication entries are discarded. When
enabled, all RIP-2 messages without authentication entries are automatically
rejected. To fully support authentication, an authentication routine should
be specified with the ripAuthHookAdd() routine. The specified function
will be called to screen every RIP-1 message and all unverified RIP-2 
messages containing authentication entries. It may be removed with the 
ripAuthHookDelete() routine. All RIP-1 and unverified RIP-2 messages will 
be discarded while authentication is enabled unless a hook is present.

OPTIONAL INTERFACE
The ripLeakHookAdd() routine allows the use of an alternative routing
protocol that uses RIP as a transport mechanism. The specified function
can prevent the RIP session from creating any table entries from the
received messages. The ripLeakHookDelete() routine will restore the
default operation. 

DEBUGGING INTERFACE
As required by the RFC specification, the obsolete traceon and traceoff 
messages are not supported by this implementation. The ripRouteShow()
routine will display the contents of the internal RIP routing table.
Routines such as mRouteShow() to display the corresponding kernel routing 
table will also be available if INCLUDE_NET_SHOW is defined when the image 
is built. If additional information is required, the ripDebugLevelSet() 
routine will enable predefined debugging messages that will be sent to 
the standard output.

/******************************************************************************
*
* ripLibInit - initialize the RIP routing library
*
* This routine creates and initializes the global data structures used by 
* the RIP routing library and starts a RIP session to maintain routing 
* tables for a host. You must call ripLibInit() before you can use any other 
* ripLib routines. A VxWorks image automatically invokes ripLibInit() 
* if INCLUDE_RIP was defined when the image was built.
*
* The resulting RIP session will monitor all network interfaces that are 
* currently available for messages from other RIP routers. If the <supplier>
* parameter is true, it will also respond to specific requests from other
* routers and transmit route updates over every known interface at the 
* interval specified by <supplyInterval>.
*
* Specifying a <gateway> setting of true establishes this router as a
* gateway to the wider Internet, capable of routing packets anywhere within 
* the local networks. The final <multicast> flag indicates whether the
* RIP messages are sent to the pre-defined multicast address of 224.0.0.9
* (which requires a <version> setting of 2) or to the broadcast address of 
* the interfaces.
*
* The <version> parameter determines the format used for outgoing RIP 
* messages, and also sets the initial settings of the MIB-II compatibility 
* switches in combination with the <multicast> flag. A <version> of 1 will 
* restrict all incoming traffic to that older message type. A <version> of 
* 2 will set the receive switch to accept either type unless <multicast> is 
* true, which limits reception to version 2 messages only. SNMP agents may 
* alter those settings on a per-interface basis once startup is complete.
*
* The remaining parameters set various system timers used to maintain the
* routing table. All of the values are expressed in seconds, and must be
* greater than or equal to 1. The <timerRate> determines how often
* the routing table is examined for changes and expired routes. The
* <supplyInterval> must be an exact multiple of that value. The
* <expire> parameter specifies the maximum time between updates before
* a route is invalidated and removed from the kernel table. Expired routes 
* are then deleted from the internal RIP routing table if no update has
* been received within the time set by the <garbage> parameter.
*
* The following configuration parameters determine the initial values for
* all these settings. The default timer values match the settings indicated
* in the RFC specification.
*
* \ts
* Parameter Name    | Default Value   | Configuration Parameter
* ------------------+-----------------+------------------------
* <supplier>        | 0 (FALSE)       | RIP_SUPPLIER
* <gateway>         | 0 (FALSE)       | RIP_GATEWAY
* <multicast>       | 0 (FALSE)       | RIP_MULTICAST
* <version>         | 1               | RIP_VERSION
* <timerRate>       | 1               | RIP_TIMER_RATE
* <supplyInterval>  | 30              | RIP_SUPPLY_INTERVAL
* <expire>          | 180             | RIP_EXPIRE_TIME
* <garbage>         | 300             | RIP_GARBAGE_TIME
* <authType>        | 1               | RIP_AUTH_TYPE
* \te
*
* INTERNAL
* This routine creates two tasks, 'tRip' and 'tRipTimer'.  The first is the 
* main loop of the routing task that monitors the routing port (520) for 
* updates and request messages. The second task uses a watchdog timer and
* signalling semaphore to update the internal RIP routing table. The 
* 'ripLockSem' blocking semaphore provides any necessary interlocking between 
* each of the tasks and the user routines that alter the RIP configuration.
* 
* RETURNS: OK; or ERROR, if configuration fails.

/***************************************************************************
*
* ripRouteMsgProcess - Process the routing socket messages
*
* This function retrieves the messages from the routing sockets 
* and processes them. It handles the following messages:
*
* RTM_IFINFO:
*       This message indicates if an interface has been brought up or down.
*       If the interface is brought up, this routine does the following:
*         For all interfaces that match the name, it marks the interface UP
*         and adds the interface route.
*         Then it calls the routedIfInit() call to pick up any addresses that
*         were added to the interface when the interface was down
*       If the interface is brought down, this routine does the following:
*         For all interfaces that match the name, it marks the interface DOWN.
*         Routes passing through the interface are deleted except the
*         routes we learned through the Routing socket messages. Those routes
*         will not be advertised though.
* RTM_NEWADDR:
*	Calls the routedIfInit() routine to pick up the new address. If the
*	interface is down, routedIfInit() doesn't do anything. The new address
*	is picked up when the interface comes back up.
* RTM_DELADDR:
*	Deletes all routes that pass though the interface whose address
*	matches the deleted address and then deletes the interface structure
*	Deleting the interface structure would cause the MIB settings for
*	the structure to be lost, but that is OK as the MIB settings do
*	not apply to an interface name, but to an interface addr. Thus if
*	the address goes away, it is reasonable to remove whatever settings
*	were associated with it.
* RTM_ADD:
* RTM_ADDEXTRA:
*	This message indicates that a route has been added. If the route 
*	is installed by us or the system (interface route) it is ignored.
*	All other routes are passed to the user route handler hook routine
*	if it is installed. If the handler is not installed the route is
*	ignored. If the handler returns a metric < HOPCNT_INFINITY, then we
*	install the route if none exists already. If a route already exists
*	for the same destination then we use the following logic to determine
*	if we need to replace the old route with the new one:
*	  If the old route is a RIP route, we replace it with the new one
*	  If the metric of the old route is greater than or equal to
*         the metric of the new route, then we replace the old route.
*	RTM_ADD signifies that it the route is the primary route and
*	RTM_ADDEXTRA signifies a duplicate route. We don't prefer
*	one over the other and let the user route hook do that.	
* RTM_NEWIPROUTE:
*	This message indicates that a formerly duplicate route has been
*	promoted to being a primary route because either the previously
*	primary route was deleted or demoted because of weight change.
*	We treat this just as we would treat the RTM_ADD command, except
*       that we mark the previous primary route as non-primary.
* RTM_DELETE:
* RTM_DELEXTRA:
*	This message indicates that the route has been deleted. Again if
*	the route has been installed by us or by the system, we ignore it,
*	else if the exact same route exists in our table we delete it.
*	RTM_DELETE signifies that the route is the primary route and
*	RTM_DELEXTRA signifies a duplicate route. 
* RTM_OLDIPROUTE:
*	This message indicates that a formerly primary route has been
*	demoted to being a duplicate route because either a new
*	primary route was added or because of weight change.
*	If we have this route in our cache we mark it non-primary.
*	
* RTM_CHANGE:
* RTM_NEWCHANGE:
*	This message indicates that either the route metric and or the
*	route gateway has been changed. We first check if we know about this
*	route. If we don't, we ignore it, else if it is only a metric change,
*	we record that in our copy of the route. If the gateway has changed,
*	we invoke the user route hook routine, if installed, to provide
*	us an alternate metric, else we use the metric in the route. Finally
*	we change the gateway in our copy of the route.
* RTM_REDIRECT:
*	This message indicates a gateway change caused by an ICMP redirect
*	message. This should happen only with static routes. 
*	We simply invoke the route Hook if it is installed to notify the
*	user of the redirect. If is the user's responsibility to deal
*	with the redirect message.

*
* ripAuthHookAdd - add an authentication hook to a RIP interface
*
* This routine installs a hook routine to validate incoming RIP messages
* for a registered interface given by <pIpAddr>. (Interfaces created or
* changed after a RIP session has started may be installed/updated with the
* ripIfSearch() and ripIfReset() routines). The hook is only called if
* an SNMP agent enables authentication for the corresponding interface.
* It uses the following prototype:
*
* \cs
*     STATUS ripAuthHookRtn (char *pKey, RIP_PKT *pRip);
* \ce
* The first argument contains the authentication key for the message
* stored in the rip2IfConfAuthKey MIB variable and the second argument 
* uses the RIP_PKT structure (defined in rip/ripLib.h) to access the message 
* body. The routine must return OK if the message is acceptable, or ERROR 
* otherwise. All RIP-2 messages sent to that routine already contain an 
* authentication entry, but have not been verified. (Any unauthenticated
* RIP-2 messages have already been discarded as required by the RFC 
* specification). RIP-1 messages may be accepted or rejected. RIP-2 messages
* requesting simple password authentication that match the key are
* accepted automatically before the hook is called. The remaining RIP-2
* messages either did not match that key or are using an unknown 
* authentication type. If any messages are rejected, the MIB-II counters are 
* updated appropriately outside of the hook routine.
*
* The current RIP implementation contains a sample authentication hook that
* you may add as follows:
*
* \cs
*     if (ripAuthHookAdd ("90.0.0.1", ripAuthHook) == ERROR)
*         logMsg ("Unable to add authorization hook.\n", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
* \ce
*
* The sample routine supports only simple password authentication against
* the key included in the MIB variable. Since all such messages have already
* been accepted, all RIP-2 messages received by the routine are discarded.
* All RIP-1 messages are also discarded, so the hook actually has no
* effect. The body of that routine is:
*
* \cs
* STATUS ripAuthHook
*    (
*    char * 	pKey, 	/@ rip2IfConfAuthKey entry from MIB-II family @/

*
* ripRouteHookAdd - add a hook to install static and non-RIP routes into RIP
*
* This routine installs a hook routine that you can use to give RIP the 
* ability to respond to route-add events generated by non-RIP agents. By   
* design, RIP is not interested in the routes generated by non-RIP agents. 
* If you do not install a route hook function, RIP continues this default 
* behavior.  However, if you want RIP to add these non-RIP routes to its 
* internal routing database and even propagate routes added by other 
* agents, you must use ripRouteHookAdd() to register a function of the form:
* 
* \ss
* STATUS <Your>RipRouteHookRtn 
*     ( 
*     struct ROUTE_INFO * pRouteInfo, 
*     int  protoId, 
*     BOOL primaryRoute,
*     int  flags 
*     ) 
* \se
* RIP invokes this function in response to the following events:
* 
* 	'1.'  A non-RIP non-system route was added to the routing table. 
* 	'2.'  A route change message arrived. 
* 	'3.'  An ICMP redirect message arrived. 
* 
* The returned function value of the route hook routine tells rip 
* how to respond to the event. In the first case, the returned 
* function value tells RIP whether to add or ignore the new route. 
* In the second case, the returned function tells RIP whether to 
* delete the specified route or change its metric. In the third 
* case, the event is of no direct importance for RIP, so RIP 
* ignores the returned value of the route hook function. 
* \is
* \i <pRouteInfo>
* This parameter passes in a pointer to a route information 
* structure that stores the routing message. You should not 
* access the contents of this structure directly. Instead, 
* use ripAddrsXtract() to extract the following information: 
*
* 	'-' destination address
* 	'-' netmask
* 	'-' gateway address
* 	'-' old gateway address (if available)
* 
* \i <protoId> 
* This parameter passes in the ID of the protocol that generated 
* the event. Valid protocol IDs are defined in m2Lib.h as follows:
* 
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_other' (static routes) 
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_local' 
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_netmgmt'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_icmp'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_egp'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_ggp'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_hello'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_rip'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_is_is'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_es_is'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_ciscoIgrp'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_bbnSpfIgp'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_ospf'
* 	'M2_ipRouteProto_bgp'
* 
* \i <primaryRoute> 
* This parameter passes in a boolean value that indicates whether 
* the route is a primary route. 'TRUE' indicates a primary route. 
* 'FALSE' indicates a duplicate route. 
* \i <flags> 
* This parameter passes in a value that indicates which event occurred: 
* 
*  '0' (zero)
* 	This indicates a route added to the routing table by a non-RIP agent. 
* 
*  'RIP_ROUTE_CHANGE_RECD' 
* 	This indicates a route change message. 
* 
*  'RIP_REDIRECT_RECD' 
* 	This indicates and ICMP redirect message. 
* \ie 
* \sh A New Non-RIP Non-System Route was Added to the Routing Table 
* 
* In response to this event, RIP needs to be told whether to ignore 
* or add the route. RIP does this on the basis of the returned 
* function value of the route hook routine. In the case of route-add 
* event, RIP interprets the returned function value of the route hook 
* routine as the metric for the route.
*  
* If the metric is HOPCNT_INFINITY, RIP ignores the route. If the 
* metric is greater than zero but less than HOPCNT_INFINITY, RIP 
* considers the route for inclusion. If the route is new to RIP, RIP 
* adds the new route to its internal database, and then propagates 
* the route in its subsequent update messages. If RIP already stores 
* a route for that destination, RIP compares the metric of the new 
* route and the stored route. If the new route has a better (lower) 
* metric, RIP adds the new route. Otherwise, RIP ignores the new route. 
* 
* When generating its returned function value, your route hook 
* routine can use the creator of the event (<protoID>) as a factor 
* in the decision on whether to include the route. For example, 
* if you wanted the route hook to tell RIP to ignore all non-RIP 
* routes except static routes, your route hook would return 
* HOPCNT_INFINITY if the <protoID> were anything other than 
* 'M2_ipRouteProto_other'. Thus, your route hook routine is a 
* vehicle through which you can implement a policy for including 
* non-RIP routes in the RIP internal route data base. 
* 
* When designing your policy, you should keep in mind how RIP 
* prioritizes these non-RIP routes and when it deletes these 
* non-RIP routes. For example, non-RIP routes never time out. 
* They remain in the RIP database until one of the following 
* events occurs:
* 
* 	'1.'  An agent deletes the route from the system routing table.
* 	'2.'  An agent deletes the interface through which the route passes. 
* 	'3.'  A route change message for the route arrives. 
*  
* Also, these non-RIP routes take precedence over RIP routes to 
* the same destination. RIP ignores routes learned from RIP peers 
* if a route to the same destination was recommended by the hook 
* routine. This non-RIP route takes precedence over the RIP route 
* without regard of the route metric. However, if the route hook 
* routine adds multiple same-destination routes, the route with 
* the lowest metric takes precedence. If the route hook route 
* approves multiple same-metric same-destination routes, the 
* most recently added route is installed.
*  
* \sh A Route Change Notification Arrived
*  
* In response to this event, RIP needs to be told whether to 
* delete the route or change its metric. If the hook returns a 
* value greater than or equal to HOPCNT_INFINITY, RIP deletes 
* the route from its internal routing data base. If the hook 
* routine returns a valid metric (a value greater than zero 
* but less than HOPCNT_INFINITY), RIP reassigns the routes 
* metric to equal the returned value of the route hook routine. 
* If the returned value of the route hook route is invalid 
* (less than zero) RIP ignores the event. RIP also ignores 
* the event if the route specified in <pRouteInfo> is not one 
* stored in its internal data base. 
* 
* \sh An ICMP Redirect Message Arrived 
* 
* In response to this event, RIP never needs to make any changes 
* to its internal routing database. Thus, RIP ignores the returned 
* function value of the route hook routine called in response 
* to an ICMP redirect message. However, if the event is of 
* interest to your particular environment, and it makes sense 
* to catch the event in the context of the RIP task, you can 
* use the route hook routine to do so. 
* 
* Within your route hook routine, your can recognize an ICMP 
* event by checking whether the flags parameter value sets 
* the RIP_REDIRECT_RECD bit. The <primaryRoute> parameter passes 
* in a boolean value that indicates whether the route is 
* primary route. If the <primaryRoute> passes in 'FALSE', the 
* route hook routine need will most likely need to do nothing 
* more. If this parameter passes in 'TRUE', take whatever action 
* (if any) that you know to be appropriate to your particular 
* environment. 
* 
* RETURNS: OK; or ERROR, if RIP is not initialized.

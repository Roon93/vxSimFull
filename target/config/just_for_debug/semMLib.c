DESCRIPTION
This library provides the interface to VxWorks mutual-exclusion
semaphores.  Mutual-exclusion semaphores offer convenient options
suited for situations requiring mutually exclusive access to resources.
Typical applications include sharing devices and protecting data
structures.  Mutual-exclusion semaphores are used by many higher-level
VxWorks facilities.

The mutual-exclusion semaphore is a specialized version of the binary
semaphore, designed to address issues inherent in mutual exclusion, such
as recursive access to resources, priority inversion, and deletion safety.
The fundamental behavior of the mutual-exclusion semaphore is identical
to the binary semaphore (see the manual entry for semBLib), except for
the following restrictions:

    - It can only be used for mutual exclusion.
    - It can only be given by the task that took it.
    - It may not be taken or given from interrupt level.
    - The semFlush() operation is illegal.

These last two operations have no meaning in mutual-exclusion situations.

RECURSIVE RESOURCE ACCESS
A special feature of the mutual-exclusion semaphore is that it may be
taken "recursively," i.e., it can be taken more than once by the task that
owns it before finally being released.  Recursion is useful for a set of
routines that need mutually exclusive access to a resource, but may need
to call each other.

Recursion is possible because the system keeps track of which task
currently owns a mutual-exclusion semaphore.  Before being released, a
mutual-exclusion semaphore taken recursively must be given the same number
of times it has been taken; this is tracked by means of a count which is
incremented with each semTake() and decremented with each semGive().

The example below illustrates recursive use of a mutual-exclusion semaphore.
Function A requires access to a resource which it acquires by taking `semM';
function A may also need to call function B, which also requires `semM':
.CS
.ne 3
    SEM_ID semM;

    semM = semMCreate (...);

.ne 8
    funcA ()
	{
	semTake (semM, WAIT_FOREVER);
	...
	funcB ();
	...
	semGive (semM);
	}

.ne 6
    funcB ()
	{
	semTake (semM, WAIT_FOREVER);
	...
	semGive (semM);
	}
.CE

PRIORITY-INVERSION SAFETY
If the option SEM_INVERSION_SAFE is selected, the library adopts a
priority-inheritance protocol to resolve potential occurrences of
"priority inversion," a problem stemming from the use semaphores for
mutual exclusion.  Priority inversion arises when a higher-priority task
is forced to wait an indefinite period of time for the completion of a
lower-priority task.

Consider the following scenario:  T1, T2, and T3 are tasks of high,
medium, and low priority, respectively.  T3 has acquired some resource by
taking its associated semaphore.  When T1 preempts T3 and contends for the
resource by taking the same semaphore, it becomes blocked.  If we could be
assured that T1 would be blocked no longer than the time it normally takes
T3 to finish with the resource, the situation would not be problematic.
However, the low-priority task is vulnerable to preemption by medium-priority
tasks; a preempting task, T2, could inhibit T3 from relinquishing the resource.
This condition could persist, blocking T1 for an indefinite period of time.

The priority-inheritance protocol solves the problem of priority inversion
by elevating the priority of T3 to the priority of T1 during the time T1 is
blocked on T3.  This protects T3, and indirectly T1, from preemption by T2.
Stated more generally, the priority-inheritance protocol assures that
a task which owns a resource will execute at the priority of the highest
priority task blocked on that resource.  Once the task priority has been
elevated, it remains at the higher level until all mutual-exclusion semaphores
that the task owns are released; then the task returns to its normal, or 
standard, priority.  Hence, the "inheriting" task is protected from preemption 
by any intermediate-priority tasks.

The priority-inheritance protocol also takes into consideration a task's
ownership of more than one mutual-exclusion semaphore at a time.  Such a
task will execute at the priority of the highest priority task blocked on
any of its owned resources.  The task will return to its normal priority
only after relinquishing all of its mutual-exclusion semaphores that have
the inversion-safety option enabled.

SEMAPHORE DELETION
The semDelete() call terminates a semaphore and deallocates any
associated memory.  The deletion of a semaphore unblocks tasks pended
on that semaphore; the routines which were pended return ERROR.  Take
special care when deleting mutual-exclusion semaphores to avoid
deleting a semaphore out from under a task that already owns (has
taken) that semaphore.  Applications should adopt the protocol of only
deleting semaphores that the deleting task owns.

TASK-DELETION SAFETY
If the option SEM_DELETE_SAFE is selected, the task owning the semaphore
will be protected from deletion as long as it owns the semaphore.  This
solves another problem endemic to mutual exclusion.  Deleting a task
executing in a critical region can be catastrophic.  The resource could be
left in a corrupted state and the semaphore guarding the resource would be
unavailable, effectively shutting off all access to the resource.

As discussed in taskLib, the primitives taskSafe() and taskUnsafe()
offer one solution, but as this type of protection goes hand in hand with
mutual exclusion, the mutual-exclusion semaphore provides the option
SEM_DELETE_SAFE, which enables an implicit taskSafe() with each semTake(),
and a taskUnsafe() with each semGive().  This convenience is also more
efficient, as the resulting code requires fewer entrances to the kernel.

CAVEATS
There is no mechanism to give back or reclaim semaphores automatically when
tasks are suspended or deleted.  Such a mechanism, though desirable, is not
currently feasible.  Without explicit knowledge of the state of the guarded
resource or region, reckless automatic reclamation of a semaphore could
leave the resource in a partial state.  Thus if a task ceases execution
unexpectedly, as with a bus error, currently owned semaphores will not be
given back, effectively leaving a resource permanently unavailable.  The
SEM_DELETE_SAFE option partially protects an application, to the extent
that unexpected deletions will be deferred until the resource is released.

Because the priority of a task which has been elevated by the taking of a
mutual-exclusion semaphore remains at the higher priority until all
mutexes held by that task are released, unbounded priority inversion situations
can result when nested mutexes are involved.  If nested mutexes are required,
consider the following alternatives:

.iP 1. 4
Avoid overlapping critical regions.
.iP 2. 
Adjust priorities of tasks so that there are no tasks at intermediate
priority levels.
.iP 3. 
Adjust priorities of tasks so that priority inheritance protocol is not
needed.
.iP 4. 
Manually implement a static priority ceiling protocol using a 
non-inversion-save mutex.  This involves setting all blockers on a mutex 
to the ceiling priority, then taking the mutex.  After semGive, set the 
priorities back to the base priority. Note that this implementation 
reduces the queue to a fifo queue.

.SH NAME
ln97xEndLoad() - initialize the driver and device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.CS
END_OBJ * ln97xEndLoad
    (                   
    char *  initString  /* string to be parse by the driver */
    )                   
.CE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine initializes the driver and the device to the operational state.
All of the device-specific parameters are passed in <initString>, which
expects a string of the following format:

<unit>:<devMemAddr>:<devIoAddr>:<pciMemBase:<vecnum>:<intLvl>:<memAdrs>
:<memSize>:<memWidth>:<csr3b>:<offset>:<flags>

This routine can be called in two modes. If it is called with an empty but
allocated string, it places the name of this device (that is, "lnPci") into 
the <initString> and returns 0.

If the string is allocated and not empty, the routine attempts to load
the driver using the values specified in the string.
.SH "RETURNS"
An END object pointer, or NULL on error, or 0 and the name of the
device if the <initString> was NULL.

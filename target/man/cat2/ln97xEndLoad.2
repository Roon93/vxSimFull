NAME
     ln97xEndLoad() - initialize the driver and device

SYNOPSIS
     END_OBJ * ln97xEndLoad
         (
         char *  initString  /* string to be parse by the driver */
         )


DESCRIPTION
     This routine initializes the driver and the  device  to  the
     operational  state.   All  of the device-specific parameters
     are passed in <initString>, which expects a  string  of  the
     following format:

     <unit>:<devMemAddr>:<devIoAddr>:<pciMemBase:<vecnum>:<intLvl>:<memAdrs>
     :<memSize>:<memWidth>:<csr3b>:<offset>:<flags>

     This routine can be called in two modes.  If  it  is  called
     with  an  empty  but allocated string, it places the name of
     this device (that is, "lnPci")  into  the  <initString>  and
     returns 0.

     If the string  is  allocated  and  not  empty,  the  routine
     attempts  to  load  the driver using the values specified in
     the string.

RETURNS
     An END object pointer, or NULL on error, or 0 and  the  name
     of the device if the <initString> was NULL.

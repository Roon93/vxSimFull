DESCRIPTION
The VxWorks kernel provides tasking control services to an application.  The
libraries kernelLib, taskLib, semLib, tickLib, and wdLib comprise the kernel
functionality.  This library is internal to the VxWorks kernel and contains
no user callable routines.

INTERNAL
These routines manage the wind work queue.  The work queue is used to queue
kernel work that must be deferred because the kernel is already engaged by
another request.  Kernel work deferred to the work queue must originate
from an interrupt service routine.

The work queue is an example of a single reader/multiple writer queue.
The reader is always the first task or interrupt that enters the kernel, and
that reader is responsible for emptying the work queue before leaving.  The
work queue writers are from interrupt service routines so the interrupts must
be locked during work queue write manipulations, but need not be locked during
read operations.

The work queue is implemented is implemented as a 1K byte ring buffer.  Each
ring entry, or JOB, is 16 bytes in size.  So the ring has 64 entries.  The
selection of this size is based on the efficiency of indexing the work queue
with a single byte index.  To advance the index, all we have to do is add four
to the index, and if our arithmatic is 8 bit, the overflow will be discarded.
The efficiency lies in the fact that we have no conditionals to test for ring
wrap around.

This library should be optimized whenever possible, because the work queue
should scream.

CAVEATS
Two constraints make the future of this library somewhat cloudy.  The
limits of 64 jobs and 16 byte jobs are pretty much hard coded in.  So its
likely that this implementation will give way someday to meet future needs.
It remains the most efficient mechanism for the work queue today.

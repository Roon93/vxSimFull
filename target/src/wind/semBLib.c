/*
DESCRIPTION
This library provides the interface to VxWorks binary semaphores.
Binary semaphores are the most versatile, efficient, and conceptually
simple type of semaphore.  They can be used to: (1) control mutually
exclusive access to shared devices or data structures, or (2) synchronize
multiple tasks, or task-level and interrupt-level processes.  Binary
semaphores form the foundation of numerous VxWorks facilities.

A binary semaphore can be viewed as a cell in memory whose contents are in
one of two states, full or empty.  When a task takes a binary semaphore,
using semTake(), subsequent action depends on the state of the semaphore:
.IP (1) 4
If the semaphore is full, the semaphore is made empty, and the calling task
continues executing.
.IP (2)
If the semaphore is empty, the task will be blocked, pending the
availability of the semaphore.  If a timeout is specified and the timeout
expires, the pended task will be removed from the queue of pended tasks
and enter the ready state with an ERROR status.  A pended task
is ineligible for CPU allocation.  Any number of tasks may be pended
simultaneously on the same binary semaphore.
.LP
When a task gives a binary semaphore, using semGive(), the next available
task in the pend queue is unblocked.  If no task is pending on this
semaphore, the semaphore becomes full.  Note that if a semaphore is given,
and a task is unblocked that is of higher priority than the task that called
semGive(), the unblocked task will preempt the calling task.

MUTUAL EXCLUSION
To use a binary semaphore as a means of mutual exclusion, first create it
with an initial state of full.  For example:
.CS
.ne 4
    SEM_ID semMutex;

    /@ create a binary semaphore that is initially full @/
    semMutex = semBCreate (SEM_Q_PRIORITY, SEM_FULL);
.CE
Then guard a critical section or resource by taking the semaphore with
semTake(), and exit the section or release the resource by giving
the semaphore with semGive().  For example:
.CS
.ne 4
    semTake (semMutex, WAIT_FOREVER);
        ...  /@ critical region, accessible only by one task at a time @/
    
    semGive (semMutex);
.CE

While there is no restriction on the same semaphore being given, taken, or
flushed by multiple tasks, it is important to ensure the proper
functionality of the mutual-exclusion construct.  While there is no danger
in any number of processes taking a semaphore, the giving of a semaphore
should be more carefully controlled.  If a semaphore is given by a task that
did not take it, mutual exclusion could be lost.

SYNCHRONIZATION
To use a binary semaphore as a means of synchronization, create it
with an initial state of empty.  A task blocks by taking a semaphore
at a synchronization point, and it remains blocked until the semaphore is given
by another task or interrupt service routine.

Synchronization with interrupt service routines is a particularly common need.
Binary semaphores can be given, but not taken, from interrupt level.  Thus, a
task can block at a synchronization point with semTake(), and an interrupt
service routine can unblock that task with semGive().

In the following example, when init() is called, the binary semaphore is
created, an interrupt service routine is attached to an event, and a task
is spawned to process the event.  Task 1 will run until it calls semTake(),
at which point it will block until an event causes the interrupt service
routine to call semGive().  When the interrupt service routine completes,
task 1 can execute to process the event.
.CS
.ne 8
    SEM_ID semSync;    /@ ID of sync semaphore @/

    init ()
	{
	intConnect (..., eventInterruptSvcRout, ...);
	semSync = semBCreate (SEM_Q_FIFO, SEM_EMPTY);
	taskSpawn (..., task1);
	}

.ne 6
    task1 ()
	{
	...
	semTake (semSync, WAIT_FOREVER);    /@ wait for event @/
	...    /@ process event @/
	}

.ne 6
    eventInterruptSvcRout ()
	{
	...
	semGive (semSync);    /@ let task 1 process event @/
	...
	}
.CE
A semFlush() on a binary semaphore will atomically unblock all pended
tasks in the semaphore queue, i.e., all tasks will be unblocked at once,
before any actually execute.

CAVEATS
There is no mechanism to give back or reclaim semaphores automatically when
tasks are suspended or deleted.  Such a mechanism, though desirable, is not
currently feasible.  Without explicit knowledge of the state of the guarded
resource or region, reckless automatic reclamation of a semaphore could
leave the resource in a partial state.  Thus, if a task ceases execution
unexpectedly, as with a bus error, currently owned semaphores will not be
given back, effectively leaving a resource permanently unavailable.  The
mutual-exclusion semaphores provided by semMLib offer protection from
unexpected task deletion.

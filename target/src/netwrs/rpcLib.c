/*
This library supports Sun Microsystems' Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
facility.  RPC provides facilities for implementing distributed
client/server-based architectures.  The underlying communication mechanism
can be completely hidden, permitting applications to be written without
any reference to network sockets.  The package is structured such that
lower-level routines can optionally be accessed, allowing greater control
of the communication protocols.

For more information and a tutorial on RPC, see Sun Microsystems'
.I "Remote Procedure Call Programming Guide."
For an example of RPC usage, see `/target/unsupported/demo/sprites'.

The RPC facility is enabled when INCLUDE_RPC is defined.

VxWorks supports Network File System (NFS), which is built
on top of RPC.  If NFS is configured into the VxWorks system,
RPC is automatically included as well.

IMPLEMENTATION
A task must call rpcTaskInit() before making any calls to other
routines in the RPC library.  This routine creates task-specific data
structures required by RPC.  These task-specific data structures are
automatically deleted when the task exits.

Because each task has its own RPC context, RPC-related objects (such as
SVCXPRTs and CLIENTs) cannot be shared among tasks; objects created by one
task cannot be passed to another for use.  Such additional objects must
be explicitly deleted (for example, using task deletion hooks).

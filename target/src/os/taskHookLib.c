DESCRIPTION
This library provides routines for adding extensions to the VxWorks
tasking facility.  To allow task-related facilities to be added to the
system without modifying the kernel, the kernel provides call-outs every
time a task is created, switched, or deleted.  The call-outs allow additional
routines, or "hooks," to be invoked whenever these events occur.
The hook management routines below allow hooks to be dynamically added to
and deleted from the current lists of create, switch, and delete hooks:
.iP "taskCreateHookAdd() and taskCreateHookDelete()" 10
Add and delete routines to be called when a task is created.
.iP "taskSwitchHookAdd() and taskSwitchHookDelete()"
Add and delete routines to be called when a task is switched.
.iP "taskDeleteHookAdd() and taskDeleteHookDelete()"
Add and delete routines to be called when a task is deleted.
.LP
This facility is used by dbgLib to provide task-specific breakpoints
and single-stepping.  It is used by taskVarLib for the "task variable"
mechanism.  It is also used by fppLib for floating-point coprocessor
support.

NOTE
It is possible to have dependencies among task hook routines.  For
example, a delete hook may use facilities that are cleaned up and deleted
by another delete hook.  In such cases, the order in which the hooks run
is important.  VxWorks runs the create and switch hooks in the order in
which they were added, and runs the delete hooks in reverse of the order
in which they were added.  Thus, if the hooks are added in "hierarchical"
order, such that they rely only on facilities whose hook routines have
already been added, then the required facilities will be initialized
before any other facilities need them, and will be deleted after all
facilities are finished with them.

VxWorks facilities guarantee this by having each facility's initialization
routine first call any prerequisite facility's initialization routine
before adding its own hooks.  Thus, the hooks are always added in the
correct order.  Each initialization routine protects itself from multiple
invocations, allowing only the first invocation to have any effect.

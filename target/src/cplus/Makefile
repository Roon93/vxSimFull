# Makefile - makefile for vw/src/cplus
#
# modification history
# --------------------
# 02d,03jun98,sn   turned rogue-wave back on
# 02c,19may98,sn   temporarily went back to old mechanism so that
#		   we can remove rogue-wave
# 02b,11may98,sn   at yogu's suggestion removed the explicit definition
#                  of SUBDIRS. A new Makefile in target/src/cplus/rogue
#                  acts as a bridge so that the automatic subdirs
#                  mechanism will work.

# 02a,19jan98,sn   removed ios and added build for libstdxx and libgcc
# 01a,18jun96,yp   created from 01c of MakeSkel
# 
# DESCRIPTION
# This file contains the makefile rules for building C++ libraries
# and runtime support

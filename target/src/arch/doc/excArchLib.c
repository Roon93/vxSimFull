/*******************************************************************************
*
* excVecInit - initialize the exception/interrupt vectors
*
* This routine sets all exception vectors to point to the appropriate
* default exception handlers.  These handlers will safely trap and report
* exceptions caused by program errors or unexpected hardware interrupts.
* .IP `MC680x0': 8
* All vectors from vector 2 (address 0x0008) to 255 (address 0x03fc) are
* initialized.  Vectors 0 and 1 contain the reset stack pointer and program
* counter.
* \".IP `SPARC':
* \"All vectors from 0 (offset 0x000) through 255 (offset 0xff0) are
* \"initialized.
* \".IP `i960':
* \"The i960 fault table is filled with
* \"a default fault handler, and all non-reserved vectors in the i960
* \"interrupt table are filled with a default interrupt handler.
* .IP `MIPS':
* All MIPS exception, trap, and interrupt vectors are set to default handlers.
* .IP `x86':
* All vectors from vector 0 (offset (0x0000) to 255 (offset 0x07f8) are
* initialized to default handlers.  A global variable excDoBell controls
* the bell that takes 660 microsecs in the default exception show routine.
* The default value is TRUE.  To turn the bell off, set it FALSE.
* .IP `PowerPC':
* There are 48 vectors and only vectors that are used are initialized.
* .IP `SH':
* There are 256 vectors, initialized with the default exception handler (for 
* exceptions) or the unitialized interrupt handler (for interupts).
* On SH-2, vectors 0 and 1 contain the power-on reset program counter and 
* stack pointer. Vectors 2 and 3 contain the manual reset program counter and
* stack pointer. On SH-3 and SH-4 processors the vector table is located at 
* (vbr + 0x800), and the (exception code / 8) value is used as vector offset.
* The first two vectors are reserved for special use: "trapa #0" (offset 0x0)
* to implement software breakpoint, and "trapa #1' (offset 0x4) to detect 
* integer zero divide exception.
* .IP `ARM':
* All exception vectors are initialized to default handlers except 0x14
* (Address) which is now reserved on the ARM and 0x1C (FIQ), which is not
* used by VxWorks.
* .IP `SimSolaris/SimNT':
* This routine does nothing on both simulators and always returns OK.
* .LP
*
* NOTE
* This routine is usually called from the system start-up routine,
* usrInit(), in usrConfig.c.  It must be called before interrupts are enabled.
* \"(SPARC: It must also be called when the system runs with the on-chip windows
* \"(no stack)).
*
* RETURNS: OK, always.

* vector.  An exception stub is created and in placed at <vector> in the
* exception table.  The address of <routine> is stored in the exception stub
* code.  When an exception occurs, the processor jumps to the exception stub

* responsibility of the C routine to re-enable the interrupt.
*
* The routine can be any normal C code, except that it must not

* and placed at <vector> in the exception table.  The address of

* exception occurs the processor jumps to the interrupt stub code, saves
* only the requested registers, and calls the C routines.
*
* Before saving the requested registers, the interrupt stub switches from the
* current task stack to the interrupt stack.  For nested interrupts, no
* stack-switching is performed, because the interrupt is already set.
*
* NOTE:
* On the ARM, the address of <routine> is stored in a function pointer
* to be called by the stub installed on the IRQ exception vector
* following an asynchronous exception.  This routine is responsible for
* determining the interrupt source and despatching the correct handler
* for that source.

* Before calling the routine, the interrupt stub switches to SVC mode,
* changes to a separate interrupt stack and saves necessary registers. In
* the case of a nested interrupt, no SVC stack switch occurs.
